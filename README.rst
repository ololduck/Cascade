Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

I have a server running constantly at home. One day, i wanted to download some new linux distribution. But I had to use a lame internet connection, and did not need the iso immediatly.
I thought "It would be great if I could send the torrent to my server, so it downloads the file and I could get it when I'm home."
This is a solution I found.

Organisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Server app - Running on the "downloader" computer
 * Android app - to send files on the go
 * Desktop/laptop app - to send files easely (not to log into ssh, ftp, etc...)
